📌 GrowWise – AI-Driven Fertilization System

GrowWise is an AI and IoT-based smart agriculture solution developed during an Ideathon. It helps farmers improve crop yield and soil health through real-time monitoring, data-driven fertilizer recommendations, and a user-friendly mobile application.

🚀 Problem Statement

Traditional farming often relies on generic fertilizers and manual soil testing, which leads to:

Inefficient nutrient usage

Lower crop yields

Environmental damage

High cost and inaccessibility of soil testing

Small-scale farmers especially lack access to personalized and affordable soil analysis tools.

💡 Our Solution

GrowWise provides an integrated system that:

Collects real-time soil and environmental data

Uses AI/ML to analyze nutrient levels

Recommends customized fertilizers

Provides insights through a mobile app

This enables farmers to make informed decisions, reduce waste, and practice sustainable farming.
